/*
 * Disclaimer this code has been writen by John Holmes and tested on An Arduino Nano only.
 * It may work on other Arduino boards but ha not been tested.
 * 
 * The sketch is used to calibrate a single servo attched to pin 4 in this case and it uses the servo.h library
 * to work with the servo. We must setup a few things for the library to work.
 * 
 * 1 create a servo object and give it a name in this case "servo1"
 * 2 we have to tell the library which pin it is attached to "servo1.attach(4)"
 * 3 to move the servo we will use an int varilble called "pos" and the comand is "servo1,write(pos)
 * 
 * The int varible will get changed using the serial monitor which has to be set to "serial.begin(9600)" in the
 * serial monitor window on your pc.
 *
